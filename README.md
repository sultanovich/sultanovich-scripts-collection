# Sultanovich Scripts Collection

A curated collection of scripts for system administration, security, and monitoring across multiple operating systems. This repository is structured to be clear and scalable.

## Structure

- `scripts/`
  - `security/`: Security-related scripts (e.g., vulnerability checks, hardening)
  - `sysadmin/`: System administration tasks (e.g., user management)


> [!TIP]
> Each category contains OS-specific folders (`linux/`, `windows/`, etc.) and subfolders for specific applications (if needed).
