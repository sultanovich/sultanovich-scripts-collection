# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for taking the time to report a vulnerability. This project takes security seriously and welcomes responsible disclosures.

Please report any security issues by **opening a new GitHub Issue** in this repository. Indicate clearly in the issue title and description that your report is a potential security vulnerability. The maintainers will add the `security` label as appropriate.

In your initial report (whether via Issue or email), **do not include sensitive exploit details**. Instead, provide a brief summary and indicate that you have additional information to share privately if needed. We will coordinate a secure channel if further details are required.

**Please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before they have been reviewed and addressed.**

## Supported Versions

This repository may include scripts and tools that evolve over time. While older versions may remain available, only the `main` branch and current stable versions are officially supported for security updates.

## Vulnerability Response Timeline

We aim to follow the timeline below for addressing reported vulnerabilities:

- **Acknowledgement:** We aim to acknowledge and respond to security reports within **5 business days**.
- **Initial Assessment:** A preliminary assessment and confirmation of the issue will typically be completed within **10 business days** of acknowledgement.
- **Resolution:** The time to fix a vulnerability may vary depending on severity and complexity, but we strive to address critical issues within **30 business days** where possible.
- **Disclosure:** Once a fix is available, we will publicly acknowledge the reporter (unless anonymity is requested) and document the vulnerability in the release notes or a security advisory.

Please note that as this is a volunteer-driven project maintained outside of business hours, these timelines reflect best-effort commitments typical of professionals in security.
